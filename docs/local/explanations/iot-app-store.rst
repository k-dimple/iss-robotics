IoT App Store
=============

IoT App Store is a custom application store tailored to software distribution across fleets of devices. This store allows you to create, publish and distribute software on one centralised platform, with reliable over-the-air updates to your devices in a secure and validated way. The IoT App Store is adopted by a large number of enterprises around the world, with a variety of IoT use cases.

The IoT App Store is a commercial service. Canonical also offers a `global store <https://snapcraft.io/>`_, open to all,all with a wealth of software available to you and your devices.

The IoT App Store supports robotics deployment and management by providing companies with a trusted and reliable infrastructure. It is suited for managing software on huge numbers of distributed devices. It is private to you, the users you assign to the store and the devices you own.

No network? No problem. The Store comes with a proxy to allow devices with restricted network access to connect to the global store, even through a firewall. We also provide the air-gapped mode of the Store Proxy, allowing devices to be completely disconnected from the internet to receive updates.
