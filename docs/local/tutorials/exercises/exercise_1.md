Part 1 - exercise: Add additional application to the snap
=========================================================

> This exercise requires having followed the [Tutorial 1: Packaging our first ROS application as a snap](../packaging-ros-application-as-snap.md).

Letâ€™s do a little exercise. Right now, our talker-listener only has one application. How about you add another one? Having the ROS 2 topic tools inside our snap would be great for some introspection.

## Assignment

Modify the `snapcraft.yaml` file:

* Add a new app entry for ros2topic
* Add the corresponding dependencies

Build and install the new snap.

### Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you will have a new command available:

```ros2-talker-listener.ros2topic hz /chatter```

* Note that the ROS 2 topic tools are only going to work with message types that are included in the snap.

## Solution

<summary>The solution</summary>

* Add `ros2topic` as a `stage-package` to have it available at run time:

``` diff
 parts:
  ros-demos:
    plugin: colcon
    source: https://github.com/ros2/demos.git
    source-branch: humble
    source-subdir: demo_nodes_cpp
-   stage-packages: [ros-humble-ros2launch]
+   stage-packages: [ros-humble-ros2launch, ros-humble-ros2topic]
```

We add our dependency (`ros-humble-ros2topic`) to the `stage-packages` list. `Stage-packages` are packages that are required to run the part. Here we decided to add our dependency to our already existing `ros-demos` part for simplicity. Alternatively, we could have created an additional empty part simply to add our `stage-packages` dependency.

* Add an additional app:

```diff
apps:
  ros2-talker-listener:
    command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 launch talker-listener talker_listener.launch.py
    daemon: simple
    plugs: [network, network-bind]
    extensions: [ros2-humble]

+ ros2topic:
+   command: opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 topic
+   plugs: [network, network-bind]
+   extensions: [ros2-humble]
```

We added another application entry to our snap. We kept the plugs and extensions and simply exposed the `ros2 topic` command.

* Build and install the new snap:

```bash
snapcraft
sudo snap install ros2-talker-listener_0.1_*.snap --dangerous
```

Make sure everything works:

```bash
$ ros2-talker-listener.ros2topic hz /chatter
average rate: 1.000 min: 0.999s max: 1.000s std dev: 0.00049s window: 3
```
