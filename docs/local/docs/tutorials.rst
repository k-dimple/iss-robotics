This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what Canonical robotics solutions are capable of while helping you achieve specific aims.

We hope our tutorials make as few assumptions as possible and are accessible to everyone. They should also be a good place to start learning.



* :doc:`Part 1: Packaging our first ROS application as a snap <tutorials/packaging-ros-application-as-snap>`
   Learn to package an app as a snap. Across this tutorial, we will explore how to build snaps for a robotics application. Through different examples, we will cover the basics of snap creation for a ROS and ROS 2 application. By introducing the main concepts of a snap, we will see how to confine your robotics application and make it installable on dozens of Linux distributions.

* :doc:`Part 2: Packaging complex robotics software with snaps <tutorials/packaging-complex-robotics-software-with-snaps>`
   Learn to package a complete robot software stack as a snap. Across this tutorial, we will explore advanced snaps topics and tools that will show you how to structure, package, and test complex robotics applications. While covering the theoretical aspects of ROS snaps, we will apply all this knowledge to TurtleBot3 for a more interesting real-world scenario.

* :doc:`Part 3: Distribute ROS applications with the Snap Store <tutorials/distribute-ros-apps-with-snap-store>`
   Learn to distribute ROS applications to users or devices. Across this tutorial, we will explore the Snap Store to distribute robotics software and update like a global software vendor.

* :doc:`Part 4: Building ROS snaps with content sharing <tutorials/building-ros-snaps-with-content-sharing>`
   From the example shown in part 2 to exemplify one specific feature of snaps, content sharing. We will therefore revisit the entire example in order to make use of this feature.

* :doc:`Part 5: Create an Ubuntu Core image for the TurtleBot3 <tutorials/create-ubuntu-core-image-for-turtlebot3>`
   From the example shown in part 2 we will learn to build a custom Ubuntu Core image for the TurtleBot3. We will go through all the steps to create a custom Ubuntu image from the snaps we've developed.
