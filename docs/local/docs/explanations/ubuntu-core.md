Ubuntu Core
===========

[Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs) is a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed and engineered for IoT and embedded systems.

Ubuntu Core updates itself and its applications automatically. Snap packages are used exclusively to create a confined and transaction-based system. Security and robustness are its key features, alongside being easy to install, easy to maintain, and easy to upgrade.

Ubuntu Core is great for robotics developers since it unlocks a complete infrastructure to reliably and securely deploy your robot, including automatic rollbacks on updates, delta updates, full disk encryption, and more. Ubuntu Core is ideal for embedded devices because it manages itself.
