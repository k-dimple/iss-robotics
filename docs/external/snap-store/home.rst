Core devices associated with the Dedicated Snap Store.   

A Dedicated Snap Store permits the use of privileged snapd interfaces, the hosting of gadget and kernel snaps, while providing a
Dedicated Snap Store namespace for snap registration. It can function in offline environments and allows full control over snaps available to

an extensive permission model which provides control over the confinement rules governing snaps published in the Dedicated Snap Store.

The use cases for a Dedicated Snap Store are broad, from IoT devices in the field to cloud and desktop machines. This includes IoT companies, ODMs &
OEMs, silicon vendors and others.
