# Core elements

Ubuntu Core is built from the same artefacts as the corresponding Ubuntu LTS release, such as [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04/) and [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) for `core24` and `core22` respectively.

Understanding how these elements come together is key to getting the most out of the system.

## Layout, storage and snaps

How everything fits together, and how Ubuntu Core is different from a traditional classic Ubuntu system.

- [Inside Ubuntu Core](inside-ubuntu-core): Volume layouts, boot process, snap layout and the REST API
- [Storage layout](storage-layout): Layouts in more detail, including description for each specific partition
- [Snaps in Ubuntu Core](snaps-in-ubuntu-core): Which snaps are using by default, and why
