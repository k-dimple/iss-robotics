How to create a ROS 2 workshop
==============================

For a practical example,
let's create a workshop for
`ROS 2
<https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html>`_
using the :samp:`ros2` SDK,
which we have published in our SDK Store
under the :samp:`latest/edge` channel.

.. note::

   This guide assumes that you already have |ws_markup| installed
   and know how to use it; if needed, see the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>` first.
   Also, our ROS 2 SDK is currently based on the :samp:`humble` distribution,
   so we'll use their
   `tutorials
   <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html>`_;
   adapt these steps for other distributions as needed.


Get the sources ready
---------------------

.. @artefact project

Let's use the ROS 2 examples
for the demonstration.
Choose a project directory
and
`clone
<https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html#add-some-sources>`_
the repo there:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/ros2/examples -b humble


Note that we're using the :samp:`humble` branch to match the chosen SDK;
adjust that part if necessary.


Create the workshop
-------------------

To define a workshop enabled for ROS 2,
put this file in the project root:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   name: ros2-humble
   base: ubuntu@22.04
   sdks:
     - name: ros2
       channel: latest/edge


Here, :samp:`base` must be the same as the SDK base,
and :samp:`channel` should be set to :samp:`latest/edge`.

Your project directory should now look like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ls

     examples  workshop.yaml


All set, so launch the workshop:

.. @artefact workshop launch

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop launch


.. note::

   The ROS 2 environment is prepared and
   `sourced <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html#source-ros-2-environment>`_
   by the SDK when the workshop is launched;
   the SDK scans the sources in the project directory
   for extra dependencies and installs them as needed.


Build the project
-----------------

|ws_markup| mounts the project directory
inside the workshop as :file:`/project/`,
so open a shell and go there:

.. @artefact workshop shell

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop shell
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ cd /project/
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ ls

     examples  workshop.yaml


Here's the :file:`examples/` directory you cloned
and the workshop definition you created.

The SDK has already taken care of installing and setting up the ROS environment,
*including* your project dependencies,
so you can start
`building
<https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html#build-the-workspace>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ colcon build


Upon completion,
the build artefacts can be found in the :file:`~/colcon/` directory:

.. code-block:: console

   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ ls ~/colcon/

     build  install  log


The SDK maps this directory to the host using the mount interface,
so the build cache can be persisted and reused
after the workshop is stopped and restarted, or even refreshed.

Try this for yourself:

.. @artefact workshop refresh

.. code-block:: console

   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ exit
   $ workshop refresh
   $ workshop shell
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ cd /project/
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ colcon build


This time, the build should be much quicker,
although :command:`workshop refresh` rebuilds the workshop from scratch,
including any SDK updates.

The host-mapped contents of the workshop can actually be seen
in |ws_markup|'s default mount directory on the host
(use your project ID from the shell prompt; here, it's :samp:`8584e57d`):

.. code-block:: console

   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ exit
   $ ls ~/.local/share/workshop/id/8584e57d/ros2-humble/mount/ros2

     apt-archives  colcon-cache  ros-cache

   $ ls ~/.local/share/workshop/id/8584e57d/ros2-humble/mount/ros2/colcon-cache/

     build  install  log


However,
removing the workshop will eventually destroy this content
unless you have previously remounted it to a non-default location.

Our ROS 2 project is now ready,
so you can run the
`tests
<https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Testing/CLI.html#examine-test-results>`_
from the project directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop shell
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ cd /project/
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ colcon test
   workshop@ros2-humble-8584e57d$ colcon test-result --all


Benefits
--------

Let's review the advantages of using |ws_markup| with the ROS 2 SDK:

- **Little or no setup is required to get started**:
  The SDK automates the installation of all prerequisites
  and reduces the inherent complexity of a ROS 2 installation.

- **Save time and resources**:
  The project is built in a host-mapped directory,
  so the build cache is preserved across workshop restarts and refreshes;
  the SDK also handles the mapping.

- **Less clutter**:
  Everything specific to your ROS 2 project is contained,
  so multiple projects can run in separate workshops
  without interfering with each other or the host system.
