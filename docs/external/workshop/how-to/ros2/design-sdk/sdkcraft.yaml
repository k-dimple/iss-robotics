summary: The strictly necessary ROS 2 development environment for your project.
description: |
  The ROS 2 SDK creates a minimum viable development environment
  for your ROS 2 project.
  It sets up a bare-bones ROS 2 workspace
  before installing all of the dependencies
  for the ROS 2 project mounted by workshop.

  A developer can thus connect to the workshop
  to immediately build the project.
