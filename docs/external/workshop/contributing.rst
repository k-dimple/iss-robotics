How to contribute
=================

We believe everyone has something valuable to contribute,
whether you're a coder, a writer or a tester.
Here's how and why you could get involved:

- **Why join us**:
  Work with like-minded people, grow your skills,
  connect with diverse professionals and make a difference.

- **What do you get**:
  Personal growth, recognition for your contributions,
  early access to new features and the joy of seeing your work appreciated.

- **Start early, start simple**:
  Dive into code contributions,
  improve documentation or be among the first testers.
  Your presence matters, regardless of experience or the scale of your input.

The guidelines below will keep your contributions effective and meaningful.


Environment setup
-----------------
#. ``Workshop`` has a client-server architecture.
   Its ``workshopd`` daemon exposes a RESTful API (see :file:`internal/daemon/api.go`) to the clients.
   To run the daemon locally:

   .. code-block:: console

      go install ./...
      export WORKSHOP=~/workshop
      export WORKSHOP_DEBUG=1
      workshopd run --create-dirs

   The client can connect using the daemon's Unix domain socket:

   .. code-block:: console

      export WORKSHOP=~/workshop
      workshop list

#. ``Spread`` is the end-to-end testing tool for ``workshop``.
   Install it from `our custom fork <https://github.com/dmitry-lyfar/spread>`_:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone https://github.com/dmitry-lyfar/spread
      cd spread
      go install ./...


   Make sure the ``$GOPATH/bin`` directory is included in ``$PATH``.
   After successful installation, you should see the help message by running:

   .. code-block:: console

      spread -h

   To run the end-to-end test suite `tests/documentation/`,  
   download the latest |sdk_markup| release from the `repository <https://github.com/canonical/sdkcraft/releases>`_
   and move it to the :file:`tests/` directory.

Coding
------

In Workshop, commit messages differ from conventional commits in capitalisation:

.. code-block:: none

   Ensure correct permissions and ownership for the content mounts

    * Work around an LXD issue regarding empty dirs:
      https://github.com/canonical/lxd/issues/12648

    * Ensure the source directory is owned by the user running a workshop.

   Links:
   - ...
   - ...


The messages rarely, if ever, state the type of the commit
(e.g. ``fix``, ``feat``, etc.);
these are used for branch naming, for example:

- ``canonical/feat/workspace-start``
- ``canonical/fix/spread-tests-github``
- ``canonical/chore/update-lxd``


Commits that focus on docs must use the ``Doc:`` type prefix
with an optional scope in square brackets:

.. code-block:: none

   Doc[chore]: Align references


PR descriptions should follow the PR template checklist,
which largely reiterates this section.


After receiving review comments,
optimise for commit history clarity.
Address review comments with 
`fixup commits <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit/2.32.0#Documentation/git-commit.txt---fixupamendrewordltcommitgt>`_ 
and rebase using 
`autosquash <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---autosquash>`_ 
when reasonable.


Reversibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When making decisions that might be costly to reverse,
explicitly state the rationale in the PR description.
This helps to understand the reasoning and collaborate better.


Coding standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Avoid nested conditions**:
  Refrain from nesting conditions to enhance readability and maintainability.

- **Eliminate dead code and redundant comments**:
  Remove unused or obsolete code and comments.
  This promotes a cleaner code base and reduces confusion.

- **Normalise symmetries**:
  Handle identical operations consistently, using a uniform approach.
  This also improves consistency and readability.


Error handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When handling errors or multiple returns,
follow a consistent pattern:

.. code-block:: go

   // one way to handle errors
   if err := f(); err != nil {
      ...
   }

   // one way to handle multiple returns
   val, err := f()
   if err != nil {
      ...
   }


Error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Be consistent**:
  Try to match the style of existing error messages.
  Most of these can be found by searching for ``fmt.Errorf`` and ``errors.New``.
  Paths and other identifiers should be double-quoted if possible.

- **Consider the user experience**:
  Error messages should be clear and actionable.

- **Be specific**:
  For example, if a file was not found, the error message should include its path.

- **Mind the nesting**:
  Start in lowercase and avoid trailing punctuation.
  Avoid excessively long or repetitive error chains.
  A common template is: ``what was attempted: why it went wrong``.


Code structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Check coupled code elements**:
  Verify that coupled code elements, files and directories are adjacent.
  For instance, store test data close to the corresponding test code.

- **Group variable declaration and initialisation**:
  Declare and initialise variables together
  to improve code organisation and readability.

- **Divide large expressions**:
  Break down large expressions
  into smaller self-explanatory parts.
  Use multiple variables if necessary
  to make the code more understandable
  and choose names to reflect their purpose.

- **Use blank lines for logical separation**:
  Insert a blank line between two logically distinct sections of code.
  This improves its structure and makes it easier to comprehend.


Linting
-------

Code should be formatted consistently
and avoid common pitfalls.
Contributions will be checked for some of these issues
using `golangci-lint <https://golangci-lint.run/>`_.
To run these checks locally:

.. code-block:: console

   golangci-lint run


Some issues can be fixed automatically:

.. code-block:: console

   golangci-lint run --fix


If `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/index.html#install>`_ is available,
:command:`git` can run these checks on every commit:

.. code-block:: console

   pre-commit install


Testing
-------

Make sure to run unit and integration tests before submitting a PR.
We use a ``go test``-compatible
`gocheck <https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/check.v1#section-readme>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   go test ./...
   go test -check.f <TestName|SuiteName>


To run end-to-end tests and integration tests with
`our custom fork <https://github.com/dmitry-lyfar/spread>`_
of ``Spread``:

.. code-block:: console

   spread tests/<TestPathName>

When running locally, you can accelerate the test runs by reusing instances 
and local LXD base images. For more examples, see the ``spread`` GitHub workflow.

.. code-block:: console

   image_dir=$HOME/images
   lxc image export <fingerprint> "$image_dir/ubuntu-22.04.tar.gz"   
   lxc profile device add default mnt-image disk source=$image_dir path=/mnt
   
   spread -reuse -resend tests/<TestPathName>


To check code coverage:

.. code-block:: console

   go test --coverpkg=<./...|package> covermode=<set|count|atomic> -coverprofile=<OutputFile> <./...|package>


For example, to measure coverage using all tests:

.. code-block:: console

   go test -covermode=count -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=cover.out ./...

To generate an HTML representation:

.. code-block:: console

   go tool cover -html=<OutputFile> -o <OutputHTML>


For example:

.. code-block:: console

   go tool cover -html=cover.out -o cover.html


The output flag can be omitted to open in the default browser:

.. code-block:: console

   go tool cover -html=cover.out


The above will work for unit and integration tests instrumented directly with
`go test`. Integration tests run using `spread` will create the coverprofile
automatically, however the artifacts will need to be collected from the VM.
This can be accomplished by using the `-artifacts` flag when running `spread`.

.. code-block:: console

   spread -artifacts=<path-to-dest> tests/integration/


How to run a local SDK Store
----------------------------

To test SDKs with |ws_markup| locally without publishing,
it is possible to run a local instance of SDK Store.
This guide uses the open-source `fake-gcs-server <https://github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server>`_.

.. note::

   This guide assumes you're familiar with :ref:`SDKcraft <how_sdkcraft>`.


Create the directory structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SDK Store relies on a directory structure
to determine SDK names and channels.
Therefore, when running a store locally,
the directory structure must mirror that of the real store.

The 'fake store' directory can be named as preferred;
however, the remainder of the structure and naming convention is mandatory.

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir -p fake-store/sdkstore/<SDK>/<RELEASE>/<CHANNEL>

Here:

- :samp:`<SDK>` is the SDK name (e.g. :samp:`my-sdk`)

- :samp:`<RELEASE>` is the SDK release (e.g. :samp:`latest`)

- :samp:`<CHANNEL>` is the SDK channel (e.g. :samp:`edge`)


Copy the SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Place the SDK files in the deepest directory from the previous step
(e.g. :file:`fake-store/sdkstore/my-sdk/latest/edge/my-sdk/`).
Rename the SDK definition (e.g. :file:`my-sdk.yaml`) to :file:`sdk.yaml`
and place it at the same nesting level:

.. code-block:: console

   ls fake-store/sdkstore/my-sdk/latest/edge

     my-sdk.sdk  sdk.yaml


Run the local store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass the top-level SDK store directory to this :command:`go run` command:

.. code-block:: console

   go run github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server@latest \
     -data fake-store/ \
     -filesystem-root fake-store/ \
     -scheme http -port 8080 \
     -public-host localhost:8080

     time=1990-01-01T00:00:00.000+00.00 level=INFO msg="server started at http://0.0.0.0:8080"


Use the local store with |ws_markup|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To override the URL that |ws_markup| uses to connect to SDK Store,
configure the |ws_markup| snap
with the address from :option:`!-public-host` in the step above,
adding :samp:`/storage/v1/` as the path:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo snap set workshop store.url=http://localhost:8080/storage/v1/
   sudo snap restart workshop


|ws_markup| will now use the local store.


Revert changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To go back to the default store:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo snap set workshop store.url=""


|ws_markup| will now use the default URL.

Documentation
-------------

All documentation resides in the ``docs/`` directory.
To build and run it at ``127.0.0.1:8000``:

.. code-block:: console

   make run


To suggest changes online, use the GitHub link in the footer of the page
or submit a PR, limiting it to the ``docs/`` directory
and following our internal `Sphinx and Read the Docs guide
<https://canonical-documentation-with-sphinx-and-readthedocscom.readthedocs-hosted.com/>`_.


Releases
--------

See the :ref:`release notes <release_notes>`
for more information on our general approach.
The steps to produce a |ws_markup| release are as follows.


Build the snaps locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Snapcraft <https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft>`_
is used to build, package, and publish ``workshop`` snaps.
All these processes run in a self-launched
`LXD <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/>`_ container.
To be able to run the build, install ``snapcraft`` and ``lxd`` using ``snap``:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
   sudo snap install lxd


Add the current user to the ``lxd`` group
to give permission to access its resources:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER


Log out and re-open your user session for the new group to become active,
then initialise LXD:

.. code-block:: console

   lxd init --minimal


Publish the release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the publishing checklist to follow:

- Merge and close the outstanding pull requests from the release scope

- Make sure the unit, integration and documentation tests are green;
  see `Testing`_ for details

- Create and push a new release tag with :program:`git`,
  using `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_

- Run the `release workflow
  <https://github.com/canonical/workshop/actions/workflows/release.yaml>`_
  on GitHub;
  this builds the release snaps for the supported architectures
  to be published on GitHub
  and adds a pull request to update the
  :ref:`CLI reference <ref_workshop_cli>`

- Generate the
  `change log <https://github.com/canonical/workshop/releases/new>`_
  on GitHub


You'll also need to update the documentation:

- Merge the auto-generated documentation pull request

- Bump the snap version used across documentation

- Generate the updated SDK definition schema
  in the root of the SDKcraft_ repository:

  .. code-block:: console

     PYTHONPATH=. python sdkcraft/models/project.py


  And copy the output to :file:`docs/reference/definitions/schema-sdk.json`
  in this repository.

- Update the workshop definition schema in
  :file:`docs/reference/definitions/schema.json`
  according to the changes in :file:`internal/workshop/workshop_file.go`.

- Update the release notes,
  adding additional information on top of the auto-generated change log
  and following the `established format
  <https://github.com/canonical/workshop/releases>`_.

- Update the `coverage map
  <https://github.com/canonical/workshop/actions/workflows/doc-cover.yaml>`_.

- Publish and merge all documentation changes in the repository;
  the site updates automatically.
