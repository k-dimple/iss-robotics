Interface concepts
==================

.. @artefact SDK
.. @artefact interface

In |ws_markup|, SDKs can act as providers and consumers of resources
such as the GPU or file directories.
Host system resources
are exposed via the :ref:`system SDK <exp_system_sdk>`
that is present in every workshop by design.

For a workshop to be operational, the SDKs listed in its definition
must *connect* to the resources they expect.
Such connections are uniformly established via the interface system.

To achieve this, |ws_markup| implements a counterpart to :program:`snapd`'s
`interface manager <https://snapcraft.io/docs/interface-management>`__,
which controls whether an SDK can use resources beyond its confines.
You can think of specific interfaces as resource *types*:
file system, hardware, computing and so on.

Specific interfaces are predefined and implemented by |ws_markup|,
so you cannot create a custom interface type.
Currently, |ws_markup| and |sdk_markup| support the following:

- :ref:`Camera interface <exp_camera_interface>` (manually connected)
- :ref:`Desktop interface <exp_desktop_interface>` (manually connected)
- :ref:`GPU interface <exp_gpu_interface>` (auto-connected)
- :ref:`Mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` (auto-connected)
- :ref:`SSH interface <exp_ssh_interface>` (manually connected)


.. _exp_plugs_slots:

Plugs and slots
---------------

To make use of these interfaces,
SDKs and :ref:`workshops <exp_workshop_definition_connections>` define *slots*.
For example, a :ref:`mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` slot
creates a source directory to be mounted inside the workshop via a plug.

Further, SDKs and :ref:`workshops <exp_workshop_definition_connections>` define *plugs*
to connect to a slot of a certain interface type.
For example, a :ref:`mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` plug
mounts the slot to a target directory inside the workshop.

You can think of the plug as the recipient of the resources exposed by the slot;
note that a slot can handle connections with multiple plugs.

Connections can be established:

- Automatically:
  By running :command:`workshop launch`, :command:`workshop refresh`,
  or :command:`workshop start`.

- Manually:
  By running :command:`workshop connect` after the workshop has started,
  or by listing connections in the
  :ref:`workshop definition <exp_workshop_definition_connections>`
  and running :command:`workshop refresh`.


All connections are subject to validation.
Also, automatic connections require plugs and slots to have matching details
and aren't allowed for some interfaces, such as :samp:`ssh-agent`.


.. _exp_interfaces_validation:

Validation
----------

All plugs and slots defined for a workshop directly or via its SDKs are checked
to make sure they can be installed as part of the workshop and then connected.
For this, |ws_markup| uses a set of internal rules.

Each interface has its own rule set;
for example, the mount interface plug can be installed and auto-connected
based on its rules alone.
However, other interfaces may have different rules,
such as allowing installation but not auto-connection for :samp:`ssh-agent`.


.. _exp_interface_connections:

Connections
-----------

.. @artefact interface connection

Interface connections are a mechanism for communication and resource sharing.
It is an integral part of workshop confinement,
ensuring that each workshop operates in its own isolated environment,
while still allowing controlled interactions among the SDKs and with the system.

Here's how it works from the outside:

- The :samp:`connections` section of the workshop definition
  and the :command:`workshop connect` command
  can be used to link interface plugs to respective slots,
  allowing the SDKs to orderly access the resources.

- Conversely, the :command:`workshop disconnect` command
  terminates existing interface connections,
  revoking the access to the resources granted by the connection.

- Finally, the :command:`workshop connections` command
  lists all existing connections and their states,
  providing an overview of how workshop connections are laid out.

Some plugs can be auto-connected to their slots at launch or refresh.
This behaviour varies by interface,
but the overall aim is to conduct reasonably in each case:
the :ref:`mount <exp_mount_interface>`
and the :ref:`GPU <exp_gpu_interface>` interfaces are auto-connected,
whereas the :ref:`camera <exp_camera_interface>`,
:ref:`desktop <exp_desktop_interface>` and :ref:`SSH <exp_ssh_interface>`
interfaces require manual connection.


.. _exp_plug_bindings:

Plug bindings
-------------

When you list an SDK in your workshop,
you can optionally *bind* any of its plugs
to other plugs of the same :ref:`interface <exp_interfaces>`
in the same workshop.

Binding a plug to another plug makes them both refer to a single entity;
any action on a bound plug affects all bindings, and vice versa.
This comes handy if the SDKs implement different features on the same resources
or simply use a singleton-like interface (:samp:`gpu` is a good example).

.. @artefact SDK publisher

.. note::

   Double-check the plug layout
   with :command:`workshop connections`;
   you may also need additional info from the SDK publishers.


As an example,
imagine two SDKs, :samp:`pytorch` and :samp:`tensorflow`,
that store their training data in the workshop under
:file:`~/.cache/torchvision/datasets/` and :file:`~/.keras/datasets/`,
respectively.
The data should be persisted,
so each SDK has a corresponding mount interface plug, :samp:`datasets`.

Now, what if our workshop includes both SDKs;
can we leverage bindings to reuse the data?
Here, the :samp:`datasets` plug of the :samp:`pytorch` SDK
is bound to the :samp:`datasets` plug under :samp:`tensorflow`:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .workshop/digits.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 8

   name: digits
   base: ubuntu@22.04
   sdks:
     - name: pytorch
       channel: latest/stable
       plugs:
         datasets:
           bind: tensorflow:datasets
     - name: tensorflow
       channel: latest/stable


This binds :samp:`pytorch:datasets`
to the location of :samp:`tensorflow:datasets`;
you benefit from sharing the data between the two frameworks,
while simultaneously persisting it on the host.

Any actions on the plug thus bound affect all its bindings.
Here, if you remount :samp:`pytorch:datasets`,
the :samp:`tensorflow:datasets` plug is also remounted
because they reference the same entity:

.. @artefact workshop info

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop remount digits/pytorch:datasets /new-mount/
   $ workshop info digits

     ...
     sdks:
       pytorch:
         tracking:   latest/stable
         installed:  2.5.1  2024-11-02  (42)
         mounts:
           datasets:
             host-source:      /new-mount
             workshop-target:  /home/workshop/.cache/torchvision/datasets
       tensorflow:
         tracking:   latest/stable
         installed:  2.18.0  2024-10-27  (37)
         mounts:
           data:
             host-source:      /new-mount
             workshop-target:  /home/workshop/.keras/datasets


This avoids the need to reconfigure each mount manually,
reducing the potential for mistakes.

When you run :command:`workshop connections`,
a bound plug will have :samp:`bind` listed under :samp:`Notes`,
along with the line number of the target plug:

.. @artefact workshop connections

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop connections digits

     Interface  Plug                        Slot                 Notes
     mount      digits/pytorch:datasets     digits/system:mount  bind.2
     mount      digits/tensorflow:datasets  digits/system:mount  bind.2


Here, both plugs are listed as :samp:`bind.2`,
pointing to :samp:`tensorflow:datasets` in the second line.

.. _exp_interfaces_cli_operations:

Related CLI operations
----------------------

A number of basic workshop operations
affect plugs and slots in different ways.

.. @artefact workshop launch

When you :command:`workshop launch` a workshop,
an auto-connect task handles each interface plug,
finding a candidate slot,
verifying the plug's eligibility for the slot based on their declarations
and connecting the two.

.. @artefact workshop refresh

On :command:`workshop refresh`,
existing connections are preserved in the refreshed workshop
if their plugs were connected before the operation.
A newer version of an SDK may drop a plug that was previously connected;
such connections are removed,
but the host-based content remains.

.. @artefact interface connection

On :command:`workshop remove`,
both the interface connections and the default host directories
(if any have been created, for example, to accommodate mount interface slots)
are removed.

.. note::

   We remove content stored in our default locations
   because it's not a good idea to keep user data forever.
   Thus, at least some commands will delete this data
   to prevent it from piling up in hidden places
   where it's unlikely to be used again.


Also, you can manually enable or disable connections
with :command:`workshop connect` and :command:`workshop disconnect`,
whereas :command:`workshop connections` can list all connections
that have been established by any |ws_markup| projects.
