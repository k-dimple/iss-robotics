# Install on a device

We create pre-built Ubuntu Core images for several testing platforms. These images are a way to explore Ubuntu Core. Canonical produces official images for the [following platforms](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/supported-platforms).

## Image writing

We recommend first users try pre-built Ubuntu Core images on a Raspberry Pi or Intel NUC, as these range of devices are easy to use and widely accessible.

- [Use Raspberry Pi imager](use-raspberry-pi-imager): install a pre-built Ubuntu Core image on a Raspberry Pi
- [Use the dd command](use-the-dd-command): write an Ubuntu Core reference image to internal storage
