# Add console-conf

Console-conf is a text-based user-interface that can be optionally included in an Ubuntu Core image to provide interactive network and user configuration.

All pre-built testing images include console-conf, enabling those images to be configuration on first boot by connecting a device to a display and keyboard. User configuration requires an Ubuntu One account and registered SSH key. See [Use Ubuntu One for SSH ](/how-to-guides/manage-ubuntu-core/use-ubuntu-one-ssh) for details.

The packages required to run console-conf are included in Ubuntu Core 22 images, but from Ubuntu Core 24 onwards, the console-conf has migrated to an [optional snap](https://snapcraft.io/console-conf).

The console-conf snap can be added to your own images in two different ways:

### From within the model

The console-conf snap can be added to the model declaration just like any other snap. Add the following to the json definition for your model:

```yaml
{
    "name": "console-conf",
    "type": "app",
    "default-channel": "24/stable",
    "id": "ASctKBEHzVt3f1pbZLoekCvcigRjtuqw"
},
```

It's also included in the `ubuntu-core-24` [test image model declarations](https://github.com/snapcore/models), although it's marked at `optional` in these. Removing the `"presence": "optional"` line will trigger its inclusion when building your own versions of these models.

See [Create a model assertion](/tutorials/build-your-first-image/create-a-model) for more details.

### Using the ubuntu-image command

The [ubuntu-image](/) command is used to generate a bootable Ubuntu Core image from your source files. To build an image from the [ubuntu-core-24-amd64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snapcore/models/master/ubuntu-core-24-amd64.model) model assertion for the pre-built images, for example, use the following command:

```bash
ubuntu-image snap ubuntu-core-24-amd64.model
```

The image generated by the above command will not launch console-conf, and instead, will take the user directly to a login prompt. This is because its model description marks the console-conf snap _optional_ and is consequently not included in the image.

To force the inclusion of console-conf, or any other snap, use the `--snap` argument with `ubuntu-image`:

```bash
ubuntu-image snap --snap console-conf ubuntu-core-24-amd64.model 
```

The resultant image will boot to console-conf's onboarding menu.
