```

```{note}
The `unix-hotplug` device type is supported for containers.
It supports hotplugging.
```

Unix hotplug devices make the requested Unix device appear as a device in the container (under `/dev`).
If the device exists on the host system, you can read from it and write to it.

The implementation depends on `systemd-udev` to be run on the host.

## Device options

`unix-hotplug` devices have the following device options:

% Include content from [../metadata.txt](../metadata.txt)
```{include} ../metadata.txt
    :start-after: <!-- config group device-unix-hotplug-device-conf start -->
    :end-before: <!-- config group device-unix-hotplug-device-conf end -->
```

## Configuration examples

Add a `unix-hotplug` device to an instance by specifying its vendor ID, product ID, and/or subsystem:

    lxc config device add <instance_name> <device_name> unix-hotplug vendorid=<vendor_ID> productid=<product_ID> subsystem=<subsystem>

See {ref}`instances-configure-devices` for more information.
