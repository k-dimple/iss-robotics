```{note}
The `unix-char` device type is supported for containers.
It supports hotplugging.
```

Unix character devices make the specified character device appear as a device in the container (under `/dev`).
You can read from the device and write to it.

## Device options

`unix-char` devices have the following device options:

% Include content from [../metadata.txt](../metadata.txt)
```{include} ../metadata.txt
    :start-after: <!-- config group device-unix-char-device-conf start -->
    :end-before: <!-- config group device-unix-char-device-conf end -->
```

## Configuration examples

Add a `unix-char` device to a container by specifying its source and path:

    lxc config device add <instance_name> <device_name> unix-char source=<path_on_host> path=<path_on_instance>

If you want to use the same path on the container as on the host, you can omit the `source` option:

    lxc config device add <instance_name> <device_name> unix-char path=<path_to_the_device>

See {ref}`instances-configure-devices` for more information.
