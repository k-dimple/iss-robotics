Workshop concepts
=================

.. @artefact project
.. @artefact workshop (container)

A *workshop*
(lowercase; not to be confused with |ws_markup| itself)
is a container that is described in a definition file,
which is associated with a :ref:`project directory <exp_projects>`.
Currently, these containers are hosted by `LXD`_,
but it's not recommended to rely on this implementation detail.


.. _exp_workshop_status:

Workshop status
---------------

.. @artefact workshop status

A workshop's life-cycle can see it switch between several statuses:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - Description
     - Definition
     - Container

   * - *Off*
     - Initial state; just defined
     - In the project directory
     - Doesn't exist

   * - *Ready*
     - Can perform meaningful work
     - In the project directory
     - Running

   * - *Stopped*
     - Temporarily stopped, can be restarted
     - In the project directory
     - Stopped

   * - *Pending*
     - Being updated, not ready for work
     - In the project directory
     - Running, being updated

   * - *Waiting*
     - Paused for debugging a launch or refresh error
     - In the project directory
     - Running

   * - *Error*
     - Non-operational
     - Can be missing
     - Can be non-operational


Status diagrams in the `See also`_ section below
provide more details of valid transitions.


.. _exp_workshop_definition:

Workshop definition
-------------------

.. @artefact workshop base image
.. @artefact workshop definition

This is a YAML file
that lists the base image of the workshop
and the specific components installed on top of it.
The definition acts as a single source of truth about the workshop.
It usually takes a few tries
to produce a definition that works for your project,
so you can edit and update the file iteratively.

A simple definition might look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: workshop.yaml

   name: dev
   base: ubuntu@22.04
   sdks:
     - name: go
       channel: jammy/stable


.. @artefact SDK
.. @artefact interface

It specifies a *base* and an *SDK*.
A more complete definition would usually list several SDKs
that use different :ref:`interfaces <exp_interfaces>`,
software packages and :ref:`hooks <exp_sdk_hooks>`.

A workshop definition can be hidden by naming it
:file:`.workshop.yaml` instead of :file:`workshop.yaml`.
If a project has multiple workshops,
the definitions should be stored in the :file:`.workshop/` directory
(for example, :file:`.workshop/golang.yaml`).


.. _exp_base:

Base image
~~~~~~~~~~

The base is a supported OS image
that is used as the basis for the workshop.


.. _exp_workshop_definition_connections:

Slots, plugs, connections
-------------------------

You can declare :ref:`slots or plugs <exp_plugs_slots>`
and list connections in the workshop definition,
subject to the usual :ref:`validation rules <exp_interfaces_validation>`.
This reduces the need to run manual commands after starting the workshop.

This example adds a slot, a plug and two connections to its SDKs:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .workshop/digits-cuda.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6-9, 12-15, 18-22

   base: ubuntu@22.04
   name: digits-cuda
   sdks:
     - name: tensorflow
       channel: latest/stable
       plugs:
         cuda:
           interface: mount
           workshop-target: /usr/local/cuda/lib64
     - name: imagenet
       channel: latest/stable
       slots:
         images:
           interface: mount
           workshop-source: $SDK/images
     - name: cuda
       channel: latest/stable
   connections:
     - plug: tensorflow:cuda
       slot: cuda:libs
     - plug: tensorflow:images
       slot: imagenet:images


Here, :samp:`imagenet:images`
is a :ref:`mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` slot,
whose :samp:`workshop-source` attribute points to a directory in the workshop.
At run-time, the :samp:`tensorflow:images` plug is connected to the slot
to consume the data from it.

In turn, :samp:`tensorflow:cuda`
is a :ref:`mount interface <exp_mount_interface>` plug
that sets its :samp:`workshop-target` to a directory in the workshop.
At run-time, the plug is connected to the :samp:`cuda:libs` slot,
so the libraries exposed by the slot are available at the plug's target path.

Also, both connections established here
are no different from those created via the command line.


.. _exp_workshop_definition_scripts:

Scripts
-------

Another optional part of a workshop definition is the :samp:`scripts` section;
it contains named shell scripts to be copied and executed inside the workshop.

The following example adds four scripts,
:samp:`lint`, :samp:`shellcheck`, :samp:`unit` and :samp:`cover`,
intended as utility helpers for a development environment:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: .workshop/dev.yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6-15

   name: dev
   base: ubuntu@24.04
   sdks:
     - name: go
       channel: jammy/stable
   scripts:
     lint: |
       golangci-lint run  --out-format=colored-line-number -c .golangci.yaml
     shellcheck: |
       git ls-files | file --mime-type -Nnf- | grep shellscript | cut -f1 -d: | xargs shellcheck
     unit: |
       go test ./...
     cover: |
       go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
       go tool cover -html=coverage.out


To run these scripts, you use the :command:`workshop run` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop run lint


When you thus invoke a script, it's injected into the workshop
and executed there in a fashion similar to :command:`workshop exec`.
Even if you update the :samp:`scripts` section in the definition,
there's no need to refresh the workshop to use the updated script;
it's available immediately.

For a quick reference of the scripts in your workshop,
run :command:`workshop scripts`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ workshop scripts


This mechanism avoids the need to maintain helper scripts manually,
ensuring instead that they are stored with the rest of the workshop's metadata.
