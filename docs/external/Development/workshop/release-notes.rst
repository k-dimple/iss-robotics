Release notes and upgrade instructions
======================================

This section provides an overview of new features, bug fixes,
and backwards-incompatible changes in each version.

Where necessary,
these release notes also include specific upgrade instructions for each version.
For additional guidance, see the
:ref:`general instructions on preparing for and performing an upgrade
<release_upgrade>`.


Releases
--------

We provide two binaries: |ws_markup| and |sdk_markup|.

- |ws_markup| (**AArch64** and **x86_64**) is designed for common users.
- |sdk_markup| (**x86_64** only) is intended for SDK publishers.


Currently, neither is publicly available,
but you can confidently use the pre-release versions.
